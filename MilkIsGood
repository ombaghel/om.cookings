Following are some test to catch the infringers red handed…
Water – The presence of water can be detected by putting a drop of milk on a polished slanting surface. The drop of pure milk flows slowly leaving a white trail behind it, whereas milk adulterated with water will flow immediately without leaving a mark.
Starch – Add a few drops of Iodine solution to few ml of milk. If the mixture forms blue colour, it’s a indication that milk is adulterated with Starch.
Urea – Take a teaspoon of milk in a test tube. Add half teaspoon of soybean or arhar powder. Mix up the contents throughly by shaking the test tube. After 5 mins, dip a red litmus paper after half a minute. A change in colour from red to blue indicates the presence of Urea in milk.
Detergent – Shake 5-10 ml of sample with an equal amount of water. Formation of lather indicates the presence of detergent.
Synthetic Milk – Synthetic milk has a bitter taste, gives a soapy feeling on rubbing between the fingers and turns yellowish on heating.
So…. test the milk taken from milkman in regular interval for one or more of these adulterants… be safe… :)
